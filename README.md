# SelfDrivingimulationProjectMain
This is the Self Driving Car Project involving CNN concept using NVIDIA's simulation. It helps to understand the principles of Deep Learning.
<br><br><b><u>Important note:</u>The IMG images folder and the csv file will automatically be generated while recording your dataset in the simulator. The images have not been 
included in the myData Folder as the dataset was huge.</b>
There's a training file along with utils.py file containg the functions for the training file.<br>
The test file is meant for the final testing and creating a socket between the simulator and the model.<br>
The model.h5 file is the model generated after testing<br>
Heavily uses the concepts of convolutional neural networks and also teaches a bit about preprocessing. Happy Coding!!!
